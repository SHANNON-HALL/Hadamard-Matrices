    "The (dephased) defect of a Hadamard matrix $H$ is the dimension of the tangent space of (dephased) Hadamard matrices at $H$, and it can be a useful tool when studying families of Hadamard matrices. In particular, it gives an upper bound on the number of parameters that a family passing through $H$ can contain. This program implements two algorithms that can be used to find the defect of a given Hadamard matrix. The first method relies on using commutators to find the dimension of the commutator subspace, and the second method uses a formula coming from group theory (with the second method only working for the fourier matrix $F_n$; the formula can be found [here](https://web.math.utk.edu/~rnicoara/defect.pdf)). We include some examples of Hadamard matrices and their defects."
