# Hadamard-Matrices

This repo contains various programs implementing algorithms that deal with Hadamard matrices. A description of each program can be found below.

## Fingerprint

The fingerprint of a Hadamard matrix is an invariant for Hadamard matrices (if two Hadamard matrices are equivalent, then they have the same fingerprint). This program implements an algorithm to compute the fingerprint of a Hadamard matrix, as seen [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.3062). We also include some examples of Hadamard matrices and their fingerprints.
